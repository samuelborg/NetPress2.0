# NetPress2.0

NetPress is a blogging platform built on ASP.Net MVC which is made up of two sections: the public area and the backend area. The blogging platform was a group assignment together with Matthew Xuereb and supervised by Dr Chriscopher Porter as part of our BSc in IT Software Development course.
	
Posts made by users can be declared as one of the following status types: Draft, Published or Archived. The public area will only show those posts which have been marked as published and it will sort them in descending order in accordance to their creation date. The clickable titles of the posts will direct the user to a webpage containing only the selected post. Posts can be further filtered by category or by author by clicking on the values. A search bar on the right hand side can also be used to filter by category.
	
The backend area, which can be only accessed by a registered and logged in user, will give full control over the logged in users own posts. This includes the creation of new posts, update, view and delete of their existing posts. Draft and archived posts are also accessible from here, where the user has the ability of filtering their own posts by status. 
	
The application consists of an administrator account, who has the added functionality of being able to edit and delete any post made by all users regardless of its status.
